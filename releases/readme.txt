CBM-Transfer Releases Folder
----------------------------

This folder contains ZIP files of the various releases.

Files with CBM-TransferXXX-setup.zip are FULL releases with installer (SETUP.EXE)
Files with CBM-TransferXXX-test.zip  are TEST releases for testing new features or bugfixes.
Files with CBM-TransferXXX.zip       are UPDATE releases.

First-time users should run SETUP.EXE to install the FULL release.

	* Version 1 should go into the OPENCBM folder.
	* Version 2 should go into a separate CBM-Transfer folder.

After that you can just unzip the updates to the folder. 
If you want to try TEST releases make sure to backup your cbmxfer.exe file first!
